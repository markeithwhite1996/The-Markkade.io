#### 🧑 Player Setup – `GuessWho_Setup.html`

* Players select which player number they are (1–6).
* Players list all players playing in game in the player number slot that each player chose (Minimum: 2 players)
* They're presented with a grid of all character images (located in `character/{characterName}.png`) to choose their secret character.
* After selecting a character, player names and positions (Player 1 to Player 6) are filled into placeholders.
* Once a character is selected, a **"Start Game"** overlay button appears, instructing players to wait until **everyone is ready** and to press the button **at the same time**.
* After all players confirm readiness, the game transitions to `GW_Game.html`.

### 🎲 Game Phase – `GuessWho_Game.html`

#### ✅ When It's **Your Turn to Guess**:

* Your chosen character appears in the **top-left corner**, with placeholder details (“Your Character” banner).

* Below that, a **5x5 grid** of characters is displayed. Players can dim (visually mark) characters they think are not the opponent’s.

* Below the grid are **five action buttons**:

  * ❓ *Asked a Question*
  * ✅ *Guessed Correctly*
  * ❌ *Guessed Incorrectly*
  * 🔁 *Skip Turn*

* When any action button is clicked:

  * It logs the action in a feed at the bottom (e.g., "You asked a question to \[Opponent's Name]").
  * Action buttons become **disabled** until the next turn.

* Below these is a **"Next Player"** button that glows when an action is taken. When pressed:

  * A modal overlay appears instructing players to wait for everyone to complete their turns.

* A list of player name buttons is shown at the bottom. If a player is eliminated (someone guessed their character), others can press their button to mark them as "out", so the game skips their turns.

#### 🎯 When **Others Are Guessing Your Character**:

* Your selected character with placeholder details shows in the **top-left corner** (“Your Character” banner).
* Two rows of six buttons display all **active player names** (disabled if no player in that slot).
* Below are **action buttons** to log opponent behavior:

  * ✅ *Guessed My Character Right*
  * ❌ *Guessed My Character Wrong*
  * ❓ *Asked Me a Question*
  * 🔁 *Skipped Turn*
* After logging an opponent's action, that player’s name button becomes **disabled**.
* Once all active players are logged, a **"Next Player"** overlay appears, reminding the current player to **wait for others to finish before continuing**.

### 🔄 Game Flow & Synchronization

* The game cycles through each player in turn.
* It’s **not synced in real-time**, but flow is controlled precisely through **player actions and readiness**.
* All game state (turns, logs, dimmed characters, eliminations) is saved and updated locally for each player.
* Once the full cycle completes, the turn moves to the next player, maintaining continuity across devices.
